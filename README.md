# Image Replace

Are you sick of looking at that pretentious unicorn in the WordPress Theme Unit Testing data.  I know I sure am, so i did something about it! And now for the low low price of absolutely EFFING free you can save yourself too!  By installing this plugin all images served via the_post_thumbnail will now be images from Futurama!

### Note: imgs/temp must be writable

## I still got a lot of work to do, like this stuff:
- ~~img cropping and temp saving~~
- addition show / topics / movie images
- Options page for ^ that stuff ( probably a dashboard widget )
